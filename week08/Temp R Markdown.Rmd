# Section 1
## Section 2
### Section 3

Text can be used here to describe the section and/or the material that is showcased below.

This is a code area.  It is named cars.  You will want to name the code ares as R uses theses for various reference points.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You can add additional code areas but its usually easiest to copy paste....and RENAME

```{r j}
head(cars)
```


```{r cars2}
str(cars)
```

To put code in line:

The mean speed rating of cars in the data set is `r mean(cars$speed)`
```{r cars3}
mean(cars$speed)
```


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
